## 🚨 Important Limitations

### Expo Go Restrictions (SDK 53+)
- **Push Notifications**: Not supported in Expo Go starting from SDK 53
- **Local Notifications**: Still work perfectly in Expo Go
- **Development Build**: Required for full push notification functionality

### Device Requirements
- **Physical Device**: Required for testing notifications (simulators have limitations)
- **Permissions**: Device notification permissions must be enabled
- **Background App Refresh**: Recommended for best notification delivery

## 🛠️ How to Test

### In Expo Go (Limited Functionality)
1. Run the app on a physical device using Expo Go
2. Navigate to `Profile → Notification Settings`
3. Enable notification permissions when prompted
4. Test local notifications by:
   - Booking a test appointment (notifications scheduled for future)
   - Using the notification demo features
5. **Note**: Only local notifications will work, not push notifications

### With Development Build (Full Functionality)
For complete notification functionality including push notifications:

1. **Create Development Build**:
   ```bash
   npx expo install --fix
   eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

2. **Install on Device**:
   - Install the generated APK on your Android device
   - Or use `eas build --platform ios --profile development` for iOS

3. **Test Full Features**:
   - All notification types will work
   - Push notifications from external services
   - Background notification delivery

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Must use physical device for Push Notifications"**
- Solution: This is expected in simulators. Test on a real device.

**"expo-notifications functionality is not fully supported in Expo Go"**
- Solution: This is expected in Expo Go with SDK 53+. Local notifications still work.

**Notifications not appearing**
- Check device notification permissions in system settings
- Ensure app has foreground/background permissions
- Verify notifications are actually scheduled (check in settings screen)

**Permission denied errors**
- Go to device Settings → Apps → ToothMate → Notifications
- Enable all notification permissions
- Restart the app and try again

### Development Build Issues

**Push token errors**
- Ensure you have a valid Expo project ID in `NotificationService.js`
- Check network connectivity
- Verify Expo account permissions

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues with the notification system:

1. **Check the Console**: Look for error messages in the development console
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure all device permissions are granted
3. **Test Environment**: Confirm whether you're using Expo Go or development build
4. **Device Compatibility**: Test on different devices if possible

## 🎯 Summary

The notification system is now fully implemented and ready for testing! While there are limitations in Expo Go, the core functionality works well for local notifications and provides a solid foundation for future push notification features when using a development build.
