# Appointment Reminder Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive appointment reminder functionality to the ToothMate app. Users can now set reminders when booking appointments and view all scheduled notifications in a dedicated screen.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Appointment Booking (ClinicScreen.jsx)
- **Reminder Settings Section** added to the appointment booking form
- Users can enable/disable reminders for each appointment
- Granular control over reminder timing:
  - 24 hours before appointment
  - 1 hour before appointment  
  - 15 minutes before appointment
- Custom settings are applied only to the specific appointment being booked

### 2. New ViewScheduledNotificationsScreen
- **Dedicated screen** for viewing all scheduled notifications
- **Organized display** showing:
  - Appointment reminders (with clinic, date, time details)
  - Daily dental tips
  - Other notifications
- **Individual cancellation** of notifications
- **Pull-to-refresh** functionality
- **Empty state** with guidance to settings

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- Updated NotificationSettingsScreen to navigate to the new viewing screen
- "View Scheduled Notifications" button now opens dedicated screen instead of just calling context method

### 4. Existing Features (Already Present)
- **NotificationService.js** - Complete reminder scheduling system
- **NotificationContext** - State management for notifications
- **User preferences** - Global settings for reminder preferences
- **Multiple reminder types** - 24h, 1h, 15m before appointments

## How It Works

### Booking an Appointment with Reminders
1. Open ClinicScreen (Clinic/Appointment booking screen)
2. Tap the "+" button to add new appointment
3. Fill in appointment details (date, time, purpose)
4. Configure reminder settings:
   - Toggle "Enable Reminders" on/off
   - Select which reminder times you want (24h, 1h, 15m)
5. Tap "Submit"
6. App schedules notifications based on your selections
7. Success message shows which reminders were scheduled

### Viewing Scheduled Notifications
1. Go to Notification Settings screen
2. Tap "View Scheduled Notifications"
3. See all your scheduled notifications organized by type:
   - **Appointment Reminders**: Shows appointment details, clinic, scheduled time
   - **Daily Tips**: Recurring dental health tips
   - **Other**: Any other scheduled notifications
4. Tap the X button on any notification to cancel it
5. Pull down to refresh the list

## Testing the Implementation

```

### Test Scenario 2: View Scheduled Notifications

```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/screens/ViewScheduledNotificationsScreen/ViewScheduledNotificationsScreen.jsx`
- `src/screens/ViewScheduledNotificationsScreen/styles.js`
- `src/screens/ViewScheduledNotificationsScreen/index.js`

### Modified Files
- `src/screens/ClinicScreen/ClinicScreen.jsx` - Added reminder UI and custom scheduling logic
- `src/screens/ClinicScreen/styles.js` - Added reminder section styles
- `src/screens/NotificationSettingsScreen/NotificationSettingsScreen.jsx` - Updated navigation

## Key Features

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Per-appointment control** - Each appointment can have different reminder settings
2. **Visual feedback** - Clear success messages showing what reminders were scheduled
3. **Organized viewing** - Notifications grouped by type for easy understanding
4. **Individual management** - Cancel specific reminders without affecting others

### Technical Implementation
1. **Temporary settings override** - Uses AsyncStorage to temporarily apply custom settings
2. **Proper state management** - Integrates with existing NotificationContext
3. **Error handling** - Graceful handling when reminders fail to schedule
4. **Consistent styling** - Matches existing app design patterns

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Edit reminders** - Allow modifying existing appointment reminders
2. **Reminder history** - Show completed/sent reminders
3. **Custom reminder times** - Let users set specific times (e.g., 2 hours before)
4. **Batch operations** - Select multiple notifications for bulk actions
5. **Reminder templates** - Save favorite reminder configurations

## Troubleshooting

### If reminders don't appear in scheduled notifications:
1. Check notification permissions are enabled
2. Verify appointment was booked with reminders enabled
3. Ensure appointment is in the future
4. Check app logs for scheduling errors

### If "View Scheduled Notifications" shows empty:
1. Book a test appointment with reminders enabled
2. Check if daily tips are enabled in settings
3. Pull to refresh the screen
4. Verify notification permissions

This implementation provides a complete appointment reminder system that's user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with the existing ToothMate app architecture.
